Features tested by Justin Couch:

Achievements:

There are 4 different types of achievements that can be earned and each
of them is essentially its own equivalence class. The types are total jump
count, total slide count, total powerup count, and maximum score earned.
The equivalence class of the jump count achievements is triggered when the
player has jumped a certain number of times. For example, there are achievements
for jumping 10 times, 25 times, 50 times, 100 times, and 250 times. Each of these
only differs in the number of jumps required to trigger each achievement. Another
equivalence class, that for maximum score earned, is triggered when the player
reaches a certain score value. The values for each achievement in this class are 50,
100, 250, 500, and 1000. What differentiates these two equivalance classes, along
with the others, is the metric tracked and compared to preset milestone values.

Achievement testing was carried out by first deleting save data corresponding to
achievements (to reset them) and then performing the actions necessary to increment
the relevant values. For example, to test the jump count achievements, I would
press the up arrow key 10 times and check to see if the achievement notification
popped up. Manual counting for me was done both by mentally counting and by printing
the current count value. Then I would restart the game (to verify persistence of
count tracking) and press the up arrow key 15 more times to check if the next
achievement notification would display (for 25 total jumps). I did not test all
possible jump count achievements up to 250 because the nature of the equivalence
class allows me to believe the achievements will function correctly when the count
reaches the correct value. Achievement milestone values are stored in an array that
is constantly looped over and checked to see if a given achievement value has been
reached. If some of these comparisons work correctly, then it's safe to assume that
all of them work since all values in the array are just integers. Similar testing
was peformed for the other equivalence classes.

End Scene:

The end scene is just a menu that appears when the player runs into an obstacle or
falls in a hole. It displays the score for the round and the all time high score
below that. It also has two buttons for either starting a new round or returning
to the main menu. There are no real equivalence classes in this context as the
testing just consists of making sure the menu appears properly, the score values
displayed are correct, and the buttons work.

When the round ends, I made sure that the character is disabled and the menu shows
up. I tested the score value text by comparing the displayed value to the score earned
while playing a round. I tested the high score value text by getting a new high score
and making sure it replaced the old value. This also involved restarting the game to
test persistence of the high score value. Testing the buttons was just a matter of
clicking on them and seeing that they either restarted the game or took me back to
the main menu as intended.
